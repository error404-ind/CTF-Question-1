    <h1>Treasure Hunt</h1>
    <pre>
        Either as a game or an adventure, Treasure Hunts are just awesome.

        I remember when I read Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson. After I completed it, I was like WOW.

        I wish I can also experience this adventure, but I can make you experience this.

        Didn't get it. I thought of creating one such Treasure Hunt but not on any Island but in the WEB. 

        OK then Let's get into it. Hope you enjoy this adventure
